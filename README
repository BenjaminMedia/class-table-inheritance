    t.string  :description
    t.decimal :price
    t.timestamps
  end

  # Models

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
	  has_children 
  end

  class Book < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_parent :product
  end

  class Novel < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_parent :product
  end

  class Encyclopedia < ActiveRecord::Base

Accessing children directly
===========================

  book = Book.find(1)
  book.name => "Agile Development with Rails"
  book.author => "Dave Thomas"
  book.price => 19.00
  
  video = Video.find(2)
  video.name => "Inseption"
  video.year => "2010"
  video.genre => "SCI-FI" 
  video.price => 22.00
  
  book = Book.new
  book.name = "Hamlet"
  book.author = "Shakespeare, William"
  book.price => 14.00
  book.save


Accessing and searching children using parent
=============================================

  product = Product.find(1)  # This is a Book instance.
  product.author

  product = Product.find(2) # This is a Video instance.
  product.genre
