ClassTableInheritance
=====================

 This is an ActiveRecord plugin designed to allow 
 simple multiple table (class) inheritance.
 
 This plugin was inspired by:
 inherits_from plugin => http://github.com/rwl4/inherits_from and
 Multiple Table Inheritance with ActiveRecord => http://mediumexposure.com/multiple-table-inheritance-active-record/

    t.string :description, :null => false
    t.decimal :price

    t.string :author, :null => false
  end
  
  create_table :videos, :inherits => :product do |t|
